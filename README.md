# GitHub e2e TripPlanner App

# Introduction
When we make any trip we have to keep lot of information about it such as Hotel reservations tickets, weblinks, important phone numbers, addresses of places to visit and restaurants. Although we can search everything in google but it is always helpful if we have already this information in one place. This Application helps store in one place.

# Web API
Trip Planner Web API project has REST APIs build in ASP.Net Web API using Visual Studio 2017. It uses Entity Framework 6 for DAL Layer. We have Genric Repository and UoW to expose this DAL to Business Layer(Service). This Business Logic(Service Layer) is exposed to client by WEB APIs.

# Angular 4
Trip Planner UI is built in Angular 4. It consumes backend logic provided by Web API.
